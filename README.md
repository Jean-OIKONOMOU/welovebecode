# About this site
This site was the first site I made, ever. I used it to show my motivation during the selection stage at BeCode. Oddly enough, even if it's really ugly, it worked ! I got in thanks to that (partly).

# Who is responsible for this ?
Just me, Jean-Adrian OIKONOMOU.

# What technologies does this site use ?
HTML, CSS, that's it.
